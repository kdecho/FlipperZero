# Some graphics fun
Place the manifest.txt file in your "dolphin" folder under the SD Card:

![manifest_location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57457139/174727907-6547e3fc-fe2c-4968-be99-d6ff8279bda9.png)

Now you should be able to see ALL the graphics, assuming you have also upped your [Dolphin level](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Dolphin_Level) to 3!<br>
Want to see them even faster? Grab [RogueMaster's release](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/releases) then press and hold the center button to cycle.
