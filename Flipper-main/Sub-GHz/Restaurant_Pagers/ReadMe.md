Official currently does not allow anything outside of the officially supported CC1101 specs.<br>
RogueMaster & CodeGrabber (Unleashed) allows unofficially supported frequencies with the `extend_range` and `dangerous_settings` files.

**NOTE: Going outside the officially supported frequencies may DAMAGE YOUR FLIPPER AMP.<br>
Please understand what you're doing if trying to break out of official frequencies.**

You'll need to edit some code and recompile if you want to break outside of the officially supported frequencies. [Proceed with caution.](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Sub-GHz/Restaurant_Pagers/SubGHz_changes.md)
