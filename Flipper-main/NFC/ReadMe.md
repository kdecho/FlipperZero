# NFC Ramblings and Info

[Fun files](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/Fun_Files) are things I use or things I'm playing with. <br>
Includes some basic/crude NFC documentation in the ReadMe.

`mf_classic_dict` is an [upgraded NFC keys dictionary](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/mf_classic_dict) (user/default) that almost triples the available keys.<br>
With it, you can recognize more (usually finding all 32) - now with sources and comments included!

Added [Amiibo files](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/NFC/Amiibo) due to popular request. (None were made by me!)

You have to check out [Equip's](https://github.com/equipter/) Mifare Classic converter (BIN to Flipper) aptly named [ClassicConverter](https://github.com/equipter/ClassicConverter)!<br>
If you're not blessed with other hardware to help crack Mifare Classic keys, give [Equip's mfkey32v2](https://github.com/equipter/mfkey32v2) a try.

The HID/picopass information has been merged into Official (and 3rd party firmware) but can be [found here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/picopass) too.

You can generate your own H10301 rfid files over at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/) among MANY other things!
