This is a new project: Pronto IR codes. With a [Node.js converter](https://gist.github.com/XMB5/a877ab620d812260f2da8380aac050d3) available, hoping to turn them into IRs.

UPDATE: [IR conversion completed](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB/tree/main/Pronto%20Converted%20to%20Flipper%20Format), though some some issues may remain. (Thanks SkeletonMan!)<br>
June 16, 2022: [Reorganization complete](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB/tree/main/_Pronto_Converted_) which included removing dupes and likely broken files!

Thank you to bi0drainx and SkeletonMan for ideas, files, coding, and general assistance

Another project, soon. [Sirc format](http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/).
